        <h2>Short info</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Kim Nilsson and I'm 24 years old.<img src="../pics/hiho.jpg" id="Kim" class="RightClass" alt="A picture of Kim, the person behind this page">
                I've studied the program "Technician" with focus on IT at the high school Knut Hahn in Ronneby.
                I graduated high school in june 2009 and after that I went to asia as tourist for about two months.
                About six months after I got home I started working on a rather boring job and gradually I started to realizet
                how important it is to have a job that you like, and thats when I decided to go to a university, and here I am.
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a person I am calm, adjustable and easy to hang around.
                My hobbies are computers, games, the guitar, but I also like the festive parts in life like go out, meet new people or have a beer or two in a pub.
                I'm a fast learner that rather try a few times more by myself than go ask for help.

        <h2>Future plans?</h2>
        <p>
            I find my new life as a new student very exciting and fun, and I hope it will stay that way in the following three years. 
            I hope to learn many new things both in programming, web and php but also in life. Learn more about myself and my fellow classmates.
            I don't really know what the future will bring me but I hope that in three to five years, I will work for some sort of 
            web optimizing, programming or graphical design company, I may even be an IT consultant. What I do know however is that 
            I will make it there and it will kick the fudge out of my old job when it comes to well-being.
