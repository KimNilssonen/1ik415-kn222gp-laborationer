        <h1>Presentation about Kim</h1>
        <h4>Short info</h4>
        <p> My name is Kim Nilsson and I'm 24 år.<br>
            I've studied the program "Technician" with focus on IT at the high school Knut Hahn in Ronneby.<br>
            I graduated high school in june 2009 and after that I went to asia as tourist for about two months.<br>
            About six months after I got home I started working on a rather boring job and gradually I started to realizet<br>
            how important it is to have a job that you like, and thats when I decided to go to a university, and here I am.<br><br>
            
            As a person I am calm, adjustable and easy to hang around.<br>
            My hobbies are computers, games, the guitar, but I also like the festive parts in life like go out, meet new people or have a beer or two in a pub.<br>
            I'm a fast learner that rather try a few times more by myself than go ask for help. <br>
